# random-mdn-serverless

Serverless functions tweeting/sending/... random MDN articles

## Setup

```
# clone the repo and get the source code
$ git clone git@github.com:random-mdn/random-mdn-serverless.git

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# that's it. :)
```

## Structure

The project uses [the Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) and currently includes one function to run every six hours.

### `tweet` â€“ scheduled function (every 4 hours)

The tweet function reads out the MDN sitemap, parses it and tweets the found article.

## Local development

To run the function that powers the endpoint you can run `npm run dev` inside of the project and it should execute the function locally.

It should look as follows:

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Deployment

To deploy and update the function `npm run deploy` does the job. To do so you have to have the proper rights and @stefanjudis can provide these when needed.
